# PersonalSite

Personal website built as a first time with web dev experience, built using the Twitter Bootstrap framework and hosted on my Raspberry Pi.  It was a great learning experience, as well as frustrating, as I had almost no HTML or CSS experience prior. Bootstrap made it very pleasant though as it makes  limited code look quite nice.  I hope to expand it and add more sections to keep track of hobbies and information, as well as add new features like smooth scrolling and slide animations.
